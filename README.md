# RFduino_AddOns
This repository contains directories of RFduino AddOns Libraries

This project was started in January 2015, upon first purchasing an arduino
then finally getting into electronics, and finally trying to get something smaller
than the arduino for small portable projects.

Although it seems that information is hard to come by for the RFduino as I discover different things
and figure out how to resolve common problems I will post them here.

One of the first steps is to create a comprehensible mind map of the RFduino Directory Structure
and this because by trying additional 3rd party libraries I kept getting compile errors mostly related
to the lack of understanding of the structure and placing code in innapropriate directories.
